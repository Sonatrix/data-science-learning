Okay, the user wants me to add comprehensive documentation to the Python function that calculates the list of golden numbers. First, I need to make sure I understand what "golden numbers" refer to. Since the initial answer assumed it's the Fibonacci sequence, I'll stick with that, but I should check if there's any other possible interpretation.

The user mentioned that the golden ratio is approximately 1.618, and the Fibonacci sequence approaches this ratio as it progresses. So the function is likely generating the Fibonacci numbers. But to be thorough, I should note that in the documentation, maybe mention that the term "golden numbers" is not standard, and that the function is based on the assumption that it refers to the Fibonacci sequence.

Now, the documentation needs to include a description, parameters, return value, examples, and edge cases. Let me outline that.

The function, let's say it's called golden_numbers(n), takes an integer n as a parameter, which is the number of elements to generate. The return value is a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The description should explain that the Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio, hence the name.

Parameters: n is a non-negative integer. Edge cases would be when n is 0, returning an empty list, or n is 1, returning [0], etc. Examples would include generating the first 10 numbers, or handling n=0.

I should also mention that the sequence starts with 0 and 1, as per the standard definition. Also, note that if the user intended a different sequence, they might need to adjust the function.

Now, writing the documentation in Python style, using docstrings. The example should show how to call the function and what the output would be. Also, mention that for n=0, it returns an empty list, and for n=1, returns [0], etc.

I should also check if the function is correctly implemented. The initial code would generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n elements. So the code would start with a list, maybe [0, 1], and then keep adding the sum of the last two elements until the list has n elements.

Wait, if n is 0, return empty. If n is 1, return [0]. If n is 2, return [0, 1]. Then for n=3, [0, 1, 1], and so on. That's correct.

So the function would look like:

def golden_numbers(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, which is closely related to the golden ratio.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of elements to generate. Must be a non-negative integer.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first n Fibonacci numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

    Examples:
    >>> golden_numbers(0)
    []
    >>> golden_numbers(1)
    [0]
    >>> golden_numbers(5)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

    Edge Cases:
    - If n is 0, the function returns an empty list.
    - If n is 1, the function returns a list containing only the first Fibonacci number, 0.
    - If n is 2, the list contains [0, 1], which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    # code here

But the user might have a different definition. However, given the lack of clarity, this is a reasonable approach. Also, the user might have intended the Fibonacci sequence, so this should be acceptable.

Now, I need to make sure the code is correct. Let me think about the code.

The function starts with an empty list. If n is 0, return empty. Else, start with [0, 1], then keep adding the sum of the last two elements until the list has n elements.

Wait, for example, if n is 5:

Start with [0, 1]. Then next is 0+1=1, then 1+1=2, then 1+2=3. So the list becomes [0, 1, 1, 2, 3], which is correct.

So the code could be:

def golden_numbers(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, which is closely related to the golden ratio.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of elements to generate. Must be a non-negative integer.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first n Fibonacci numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

    Examples:
    >>> golden_numbers(0)
    []
    >>> golden_numbers(1)
    [0]
    >>> golden_numbers(5)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

    Edge Cases:
    - If n is 0, the function returns an empty list.
    - If
