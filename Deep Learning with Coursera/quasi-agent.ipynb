      "\n",
      "Wait, the golden ratio is approximately 1.618, and it's often denoted by the Greek letter phi (φ). But the user mentioned \"golden numbers\" as a list. Maybe they want a list of numbers that are related to the golden ratio, like the Fibonacci sequence, which approaches the golden ratio as it progresses. Alternatively, maybe they want the sequence of numbers that are part of the golden ratio's properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the \"golden numbers\" as numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence, since the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio. So maybe the function is supposed to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain point, or generate numbers that are related to the golden ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the golden numbers are numbers that are generated by some formula involving the golden ratio. For example, numbers that are in the form of φ^n, but that's probably more complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user hasn't given a clear definition. So I need to make an assumption here. Since the term \"golden numbers\" isn't standard, perhaps the user is referring to the Fibonacci sequence, which is closely related to the golden ratio. So maybe the function should generate the Fibonacci numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the sequence of numbers that are part of the golden ratio's convergents, like the fractions that approximate the golden ratio. For example, the continued fraction expansion of the golden ratio is [1; 1, 1, 1, ...], so the convergents are 1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, etc., which are the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the user is expecting a list of numbers that are generated by the golden ratio. For example, the golden ratio is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618. So maybe the function generates numbers that are multiples of this ratio, but that's not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the \"golden numbers\" as numbers that are part of the sequence generated by the formula: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), but that's the Fibonacci sequence again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the \"golden numbers\" as numbers that are in the form of the golden ratio's powers, but that's not a standard sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user hasn't provided a clear definition, I need to make an educated guess. Given that the golden ratio is closely tied to the Fibonacci sequence, I'll proceed under the assumption that the user wants the Fibonacci sequence as the \"golden numbers\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So the function should generate the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones. However, sometimes the sequence starts with 1 and 1. So I need to clarify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants the list of numbers that are part of the golden ratio's properties. For example, the numbers that are in the sequence generated by the formula a(n) = φ^n, but that's more of a mathematical sequence, but it's not a standard sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the \"golden numbers\" as the numbers that are in the sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, starting with 1 and 1. So that's the Fibonacci sequence again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, the function can generate the Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit. But the user didn't specify a limit. So perhaps the function should generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is a parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the function could be something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "def golden_numbers(n):\n",
      "    # generate first n Fibonacci numbers\n",
      "    # starting with 0 and 1\n",
      "    # or starting with 1 and 1?\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. So maybe the function should generate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the user might have a different definition. But given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility is that the user wants the list of numbers that are in the golden ratio. For example, numbers that are in the ratio of 1:φ, but that's not a standard sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the \"golden numbers\" as the numbers that are generated by the formula (a + b√5)/2, where a and b are integers. But that's more complex.\n",

First, I need to make sure I understand what \"golden numbers\" refer to. Since the initial answer assumed it's the Fibonacci sequence, I'll stick with that, but I should check if there's any other possible interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that the golden ratio is approximately 1.618, and the Fibonacci sequence approaches this ratio as it progresses. So the function is likely generating the Fibonacci numbers. But to be thorough, I should note that in the documentation, maybe mention that the term \"golden numbers\" is not standard, and that the function is based on the assumption that it refers to the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the documentation needs to include a description, parameters, return value, examples, and edge cases. Let me outline that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function, let's say it's called golden_numbers(n), takes an integer n as a parameter, which is the number of elements to generate. The return value is a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The description should explain that the Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio, hence the name.\n",

      "Parameters: n is a non-negative integer. Edge cases would be when n is 0, returning an empty list, or n is 1, returning [0], etc. Examples would include generating the first 10 numbers, or handling n=0.\n",

      "I should also mention that the sequence starts with 0 and 1, as per the standard definition. Also, note that if the user intended a different sequence, they might need to adjust the function.\n",

      "Now, writing the documentation in Python style, using docstrings. The example should show how to call the function and what the output would be. Also, mention that for n=0, it returns an empty list, and for n=1, returns [0], etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if the function is correctly implemented. The initial code would generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n elements. So the code would start with a list, maybe [0, 1], and then keep adding the sum of the last two elements until the list has n elements.\n",

      "But the user might have a different definition. However, given the lack of clarity, this is a reasonable approach. Also, the user might have intended the Fibonacci sequence, so this should be acceptable.\n",
